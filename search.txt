* How number of credits compare between universities ?

* Differential geometry class in first year "Geometry":
  1. are there equivalents in the other universities ?
    http://localhost:8503/?view=tab_search&search=geometry

    - Milano: Mathematical Analysis I and Geometry (12 ECTS, Year 1 Fall)
    - Munich: Mathematics I (10 ECTS, Year 1 Fall)
    - EPFL: Geometry (3 ECTS, Year 1 Spring)
    - TU Delft: Surveying and Mapping (4 ECTS, Year 2 Spring)
    - Munich: Design and Construction III (5 ECTS, Year 2 Spring)

   2. Are there classes teaching curvature in geoemtry ?    
    http://localhost:8503/?view=tab_search&search=curvature
    - EPFL: Geometry (3 ECTS, Year 1 Spring)
    - EPFL: Structural mechanics (for GC) (4 ECTS, Year 2 Fall)
    - Milano: Structural Design (12 ECTS, Year 3 Annual)

    can it be removed ? I would say yes as differential geometry and curvature is not
    particularly useful but for advanced continuum mechanics

* Is the content of Analysis IV to be made mandatory?
  Mainly it deals with laplace transform to solve for partial diff eq.

  - ETHZ: Analysis III (3 ECTS, Year 2 Fall)
  - Milano: Differential equations (10 ECTS, Year 2 Fall)
  - TU Delft: Differential equations (3 ECTS, Year 2 Fall)

  Fourier transforms are viewed in: Analysis III

* What abount Continuum Mechanics with 5 credits ?
  http://localhost:8503/?view=tab_search&search=mechanics

  - Munich is doing "Technical Mechanics I for civil engineers" with 10 ECTS
  - @EPFL continuum mechanics only 3 credits + overlap (Structural mechanics)
  
* What and when pure IC courses are though ?
  http://localhost:8503/?view=tab_search&search=comput

  - Milano: Computer Science (8 ECTS, Year 1 Fall)
  - Munich: Computation in Civil and Environmental Engineering I (5 ECTS, Year 1 Fall)
  - EPFL: Information, Computation, Communication (6 ECTS, Year 1 Fall)
  - Munich: Computation in Civil and Environmental Engineering II (5 ECTS, Year 1 Spring)
  
  - Milano: Differential equations (10 ECTS, Year 2 Fall)
  - Munich: Mathematics III (5 ECTS, Year 2 Fall)
  - TU Delft: Designing Constructions and Foundations II (5 ECTS, Year 2 Spring)
  
  - ETHZ: Scientific Computing (4 ECTS, Year 3 Spring)
  
  http://localhost:8503/?view=tab_search&search=numerical

  - EPFL: Analysis I (6 ECTS, Year 1 Fall)
  - ETHZ: Statistics and Probability Theory (5 ECTS, Year 1 Spring)
  - ETHZ: Mecanics II (6 ECTS, Year 1 Spring)
  - Milano: Mathematical Analysis II (8 ECTS, Year 1 Spring)

  - Milano: Surveying and Data processing (12 ECTS, Year 2 Fall)
  - TU Delft: Probability and Statistics (3 ECTS, Year 2 Fall)
  - Munich: Mathematics III (5 ECTS, Year 2 Fall)
  - TU Delft: Numerical mathematics (3 ECTS, Year 2 Spring)
  
  - EPFL: Numerical analysis (3 ECTS, Year 3 Fall)

* When and how are the sustainability courses ?
  http://localhost:8503/?view=tab_search&search=sustain

  - TU Delft: Construction materials and sustainability (5 ECTS, Year 1 Spring)
  - Munich: Fundamentals of Processoriented Planning and Organisation (5 ECTS, Year 2 Fall)

* Does other uni match the content of static II    
  http://localhost:8503/?view=tab_per_class&class=Structures%20I

  - ETHZ: Theory of Structures I (5 ECTS, Year 2)
  - Milano: Structural Mechanics (12 ECTS, Year 2)
  - TU Delft: Structural mechanics I (5 ECTS, Year 1)
  - Munich: Statics I (5 ECTS, Year 2)
  - EPFL: Structures I (3 ECTS, Year 1)
  
  It looks like it is either not the right Year, either it is not enough credits

* How to define the philosohpy/culture of universities ?
  http://localhost:8503/?view=tab_search&search=design

  - Clearly ETHZ and Milano prefer to do design/practice stuff in the end of BA
  - TU EFPL and Munich prefer early
  
* Technical Drawing in other universities ?
  http://localhost:8503/?view=tab_search&search=draw

  - TU Delft: Construction Site 1-1 (Workbook) (2 ECTS, Year 1 Fall)
  - TU Delft: Construction Site 1-2 (Drawing and planning) (2 ECTS, Year 1)
  - Munich: Design and Construction II (5 ECTS, Year 1 Spring)
  - ETHZ: Project Work Conceptual Design (3 ECTS, Year 3 Fall)
  
* Geology: when and how much ?
  http://localhost:8503/?view=tab_search&search=geology

  - ETHZ: Geology and petrography (4 ECTS, Year 1 Fall)
  - EPFL: Geology (4 ECTS, Year 2 Fall)
  - TU Delft: Hydrology (5 ECTS, Year 2 Spring)

* Concrete design et cours nussbaumer bachelor ou master ?
  do not know yet...
